- ObjectBox for local data persistence
- Firebase for push notifications
- Background location tracking

**Database & Analytics:**
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- DuckDB for analytics and reporting
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- Automated backups every 6 hours

### Performance Metrics

- **API Response Time:** < 50ms average (3x faster with Bun)
- **Page Load Time:** < 1.5 seconds
- **Mobile App Startup:** < 2 seconds
- **Order Processing:** 500+ orders/second capability
- **Concurrent Users:** 200+ drivers + 50+ managers
- **Database Query Optimization:** 85% faster than initial design

### Results & Impact

- **60% reduction** in order processing time
- **99.95% uptime** with zero critical incidents
- **40% increase** in driver efficiency
- **Real-time visibility** across all operations
- **30% reduction** in customer complaints
- **ROI achieved** within 2 months

### Technical Challenges Solved
